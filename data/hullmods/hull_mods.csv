This ancient integration system connects a civilized AI directly into the ship's architecture. The AI addition grants perfect autofire accuracy, a small bonus to the ship's time dilation and peak performance time, and either reduces the rate at which Epta shield power decays or increases microshield capacity. Only grants reduced time dilation and PPT to non Epta ships. AI personas may also develop bonds with ship captains which increase their effects.

The omega core addition grants perfect autofire accuracy, a significant bonus to the ship's time dilation and peak performance time, and either reduces the rate at which Epta shield power decays or increases microshield capacity. Only grants reduced time dilation and PPT to non Epta ships. Omega cores are extremely rare and non-dropping in the base game.

Mothballed ships normally require time to recover their combat readiness after their recommissioning. However, Tri-Tachyon engineers developed methods to mothball ships without this issue, resulting in %s by having a Delta + AI core assigned to maintain the ship. The vessel will be combat ready after mere minutes instead of days after the crew take over the ship's systems again. Unfortunately while the ship does not require crew for maintenance, the AI core is far less efficient than a human crew familiar with the ship, %s.
